    "# Multi-Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can use the Generative AI Toolkit to implement a multi-agent architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example here, we'll build an agent whose job it is to give the user information on the city they want to travel to.\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent, the supervisor, has two subordinate agents that it can hand tasks to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weather agent: to get the weather forecast for the city\n",
    "- Events agents: to get a list of upcoming concerts and other events in the city\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the multi-agent architecture by simply registering subordinate agents as tools with a higher-level agent. To be able to use an agent as tool, the agent must have a `name` and a `description`. Providing an `input_schema` is optional, but can be used to signal to the supervisor agent that it should send certain fields to the subordinate agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example here we just have a 2-level hierarchy: one supervisor, and 2 subordinate agents. You could add more levels if you want; one of the subordinate agents could itself be a supervisor to its own set of subordinate agents."
