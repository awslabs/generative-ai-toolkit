    "- **cases**: A list of cases to run through the agent. These cases are user-defined. A case, defined by the developer, allows for creating different tests with various possible inputs from the user. These cases will be tested against the metrics defined in the `.eval` method. For example, if you define two cases, two models to test, and two metrics, GenerativeAIToolkit will run the two metrics across four conversation traces. This notebook includes three sample test cases: `[inputs_only_case, similarity_case, conv_expectation_case]`.\n",
    "- **agent_factory**: The factory method to create the agent, here it is `BedrockConverseAgent`.\n",
    "- **agent_parameters**: A dictionary of parameters to configure the agent:\n",
    "  - **system_prompt**: The prompt to guide the agent's responses.\n",
    "  - **temperature**: The temperature setting for the agent, affecting response randomness.\n",
    "  - **tools**: Tools available to the agent.\n",
    "  - **model_id**: The model ID evaluated by the `Evaluate` function, selecting AWS Bedrock Converse API supported models such as: `\"anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0\"` and `\"anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0\"`.\n",
    "- **executor**: The executor to run the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "With traces, we can then run evaluation metrics on the different turns within the trace. A turn in the trace is a turn in the conversation which can come from the LLM or the user. With metric scoring, we can then log, alert, or perform other actions when the conversation deviates from the expected response.\n"
