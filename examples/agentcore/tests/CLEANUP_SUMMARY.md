# Test Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Duplications
- Eliminated duplicate test methods between files
- Removed redundant MCP protocol testing code
- Consolidated similar functionality into appropriate files

### 2. Proper Test Organization

#### Agent Tests (`examples/agentcore/tests/agent/`)
- `test_authenticated_mcp_client.py` - **Working example** for authenticated MCP client integration
  - Tests OAuth Bearer token authentication
  - Tests full connection lifecycle
  - Tests tool listing and calling with authentication
  - Tests health checks and context manager usage

#### MCP Server Tests (`examples/agentcore/tests/mcp_server/`)
- `test_mcp_server_deployment.py` - Deployment and protocol verification
  - Tests runtime and endpoint existence
  - Tests basic MCP protocol accessibility (without auth)
  - Tests protocol compliance and error handling
  
- `test_mcp_server_health.py` - Monitoring and observability
  - Tests CloudWatch logs availability
  - Tests CloudWatch metrics availability

### 3. Eliminated Redundancies
- Removed duplicate runtime/endpoint existence checks
- Removed duplicate MCP protocol testing
- Simplified error handling patterns
- Focused each test file on its specific responsibility

### 4. Maintained Working Examples
- Kept the authenticated MCP client tests as the working reference implementation
- Preserved all authentication and integration testing functionality
- Maintained comprehensive test coverage for the agent components

## Result
Clean, organized test structure with no duplications and clear separation of concerns between agent and MCP server testing.
