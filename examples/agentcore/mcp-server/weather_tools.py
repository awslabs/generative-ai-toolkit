"""
Implementation of weather tools for MCP server using Pydantic models.

This module implements weather tools for the FastMCP server and demonstrates:

1. Using Pydantic models for input/output validation
2. Tool registration with FastMCP decorators
3. Clear tool specifications for LLM consumption
4. Proper error handling and response structuring

The tools provide weather information and forecasts for cities via MCP protocol.

    Register weather tools with the FastMCP server.

    Note: The LLM learns about available tools from the **Request Pydantic models**:

    - **Model docstrings** (like WeatherRequest.__doc__): Provide the tool
      description and usage guidance that help the LLM decide WHEN to use each tool.
      These contain examples of user queries that should trigger the tool.

    - **Field descriptions**: Define parameter types, validation rules, and
      constraints that tell the LLM HOW to structure the tool parameters correctly.

    FastMCP automatically transforms these Pydantic models into JSON schemas that
    the LLM consumes. The Request model docstrings are the primary source for
    tool selection guidance - make sure they clearly describe when to use each
    tool and include realistic usage examples.
