A case, defined by the developer, allows for creating different tests with various possible inputs from the user. These cases will be tested against the metrics defined in the `.eval` method. For example, if you define two cases, two models to test, and two metrics, GenerativeAIToolkit will run the two metrics across four conversation traces. This notebook includes three sample test cases: `[inputs_only_case, similarity_case, conv_expectation_case]`.\n",
